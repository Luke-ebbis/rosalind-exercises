# Sibbe's Rosalind work

## About this repository

Here I keep all my Rosalind practice scripts that I've used to hone my
bioinformatics understanding. The first scripts that I worked on, I have made
during the advanced bioinformatics course at the Wageningen University and
Research (WUR). These are all python scripts. The first script that I have
written, `dna/dna.py` and `ini2/SB_ini2.py` differ  considerably in quality
from the later scripts I have written for that course: `orf/orf.py`,
`subs/subs.py` and `mprt/mprt.py`. After the course finalised, I continued to
add scripts to this repo for my own practice in the languages that I had
interest in learning more about: `perl` and `julia`.

All the programmes are made to take the same basic arguments: the input file 
from rosalind and they print the output always. The only programme that does not 
follow this rule is the `rust` implementation. Here the task is provided as an
argument.
