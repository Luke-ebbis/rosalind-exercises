# Sibbe's Rosalind work

## About this repository

Here I keep all my Rosalind practice scripts that I've used to hone my bioinformatics understanding. The first scripts that I worked on, I have made during the advanced bioinformatics course at the Wageningen University and Research (WUR). These are all python scripts. The first script that I have written, `dna/dna.py` and `ini2/SB_ini2.py` differ  considerably in quality from the later scripts I have written for that course: `orf/orf.py`, `subs/subs.py` and `mprt/mprt.py`. After the course finalised, I continued to add scripts to this repo for my own practice in the languages that I had interest in learning more about: `perl` and `julia`.
